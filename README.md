# Zmerge
Merge Zwift FIT file with QZ Fitness FIT file to add Zwift location data to QZ Fitness

Zmerge is used to resolve a problem - Zwift FIT files calculate elevation/altitude incorrectly for treadmill incline. Specifically, negative incline is assigned 0 elevation. QZ FIT files, when synced to Zwift activities, donâ€™t contain Zwift's location data (virtual lat/long), but they do contain correct calculated elevation. Zmerge will merge Zwifts FIT location data (and any other important data fields) with QZs FIT data including calculated elevation.
